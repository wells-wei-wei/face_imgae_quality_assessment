This code demonstrate the algorithm proposed in the following paper. Simply run 'demo' under Matlab (R2013b or later) to view the face quality accessing results. The code takes around 0.2 second for processing each face after initial data loading on my desktop PC. If you find the code useful, please cite the following paper. Try it and have fun! Have you any problem, please contact me at jschenthu@tsinghua.edu.cn.
